# MaaEnd Configuration Guide

## What is MaaEnd?

MaaEnd is a third-party automation tool for Arknights: Endfield. Based on visual AI technology, it can automatically complete repetitive daily tasks such as Protocol Space.

**For more information, see:**

{ name: 'MaaEnd GitHub', link: 'https://github.com/MaaEnd/MaaEnd', image: { light: '/icons/github.svg', dark: '/icons/github-dark.svg', }, },]"/>

## Install MaaEnd

1. Download the archive from <Pill name="MaaEnd Website" image="https://maaend.com/favicon.ico" link="https://maaend.com/"/> or <Pill name="MaaEnd Repository" :image="{ light: '/icons/github.svg', dark: '/icons/github-dark.svg', }" link="https://github.com/MaaEnd/MaaEnd/releases/latest"/>.
2. Extract the MaaEnd archive to any folder.

::: warning Two Places Not to Extract It
- **Not into a path with non-ASCII characters in it.** Those paths cause failures that are hard to diagnose. Use a plain English path like `D:\MaaEnd`.
- **Not inside the AUTO-MAS root directory.** Like other scripts, anything in there risks being deleted by accident.
:::

## Configure the Script

1. Go to **Script Management**, click **New Script**, and select **MaaEnd Script**.
![Create MaaEnd script](/docs/img/script-guide/maaend/选择脚本.png)

2. In the opened script configuration, click **Select folder** for **MaaEnd path**, then open the directory where MaaEnd is located.
![Script configuration](/docs/img/script-guide/maaend/脚本配置.png)

3. Adjust the following configuration as needed:

   | Configuration | What to enter |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Controller type** | PC client or emulator. **The PC client is recommended.** What you pick here overrides the setting inside MaaEnd. |
   | **Game path (PC)** | Pick `Endfield.exe`, **not** the Hypergryph launcher |
   | **Game launch arguments (PC)** | Leave empty |
   | **Wait time after game startup (PC)** | How many seconds to wait after launching the game before automation starts. Default is 60. |
   | **Close game after task completion** | Whether to close the game automatically once every user has finished |
   | **Proxy timeout limit** | How many minutes without log activity counts as a hang. Default is 10. |
   | **Daily proxy count limit** | Maximum runs per user per day. `0` means unlimited. |
   | **Maximum retry count per run** | How many times to retry after a failure. Default is 3. |

4. Click **Save Configuration**.

::: warning Using an Emulator? Check the Version First
Two prerequisites when you set the controller type to emulator (ADB):

- Configure the emulator under **Emulator Management** first, or it won't connect.
- **MaaEnd must be v5.4.0 or the public beta.** Upstream MFW changed its naming rules, and older versions won't receive the emulator parameters AUTO-MAS passes them.
:::

## Configure Users

1. In the script table under **Script Management**, click **Add user** to add a user.

2. Fill in user information according to the hints on the settings card.
![User information](/docs/img/script-guide/maaend/用户配置-1.png)

### User Configuration Fields

#### Basic Information

| Configuration | What to enter |
| --- | --- |
| **Username** | A display name you'll recognize |
| **Enabled status** | Disabled users are skipped |
| **Account ID** | Endfield login phone number, 11 digits. Leave it empty to skip switching and use whichever account is already logged in. |
| **Password** | Has no effect right now. You can leave it empty. |
| **Configuration source** | `Script-level` shares one MaaEnd config across all users; `User-level` gives this user its own |
| **Take over specific game configuration** | Turn this on to use the task configuration below. Leave it off to run purely from the saved config file. |
| **Remaining days** | How many days of automation are left. `-1` means unlimited. Each successful run subtracts a day; at 0 the user is skipped. |
| **Notes** | Anything you like |

#### Task Configuration

AUTO-MAS enables and disables tasks in MaaEnd according to your settings. **Tasks your MaaEnd doesn't have are simply skipped** — that isn't an error.

##### Sanity Task Options

These only appear when the sanity task is enabled. They let you change the sanity task settings without opening MaaEnd.

::: tip Prefer MAS Built-in Account Switching
Of the two methods, **MAS built-in account switching** is generally more stable, so try that first. If switching fails, change to MaaEnd account switching — once you do, AUTO-MAS adds the account-switching task for you, so you don't have to add it inside MaaEnd yourself.

## Skland Automatic Check-In

This moved to the [Game Check-in tool](/en/docs/advanced-features/game-sign). Configure it there.

## Extra Result Notifications

Turn either of these on and the notification carries an extra report:

- **Mechanism filtering on the matrix farming task** - adds the matrix farming results.
- **Gacha count calculation** - adds the gacha count results.

## FAQ

### A run failed partway through

Check whether it was one of these:

- **You were using the computer during the run.** Foreground mode takes over the mouse completely, so touching the keyboard or mouse interrupts it. If you need the machine while it runs, switch to an emulator.
- **You lowered the wait time.** Endfield is slow to start. Don't go below the default 60 seconds — if automation begins before the game finishes loading, it will fail.
- **Frame interpolation or picture enhancement is on.** That breaks MaaEnd's screenshots. Turn it off.

### How should I set the resolution?

MaaEnd requires a **16:9** ratio. Note that in fullscreen the actual resolution comes from your **monitor settings**, so changing it inside the game achieves nothing.

### Which exe is the game path?

`Endfield.exe`, **not the Hypergryph launcher**. This is the most common mistake.
