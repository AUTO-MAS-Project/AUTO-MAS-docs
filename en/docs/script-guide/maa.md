::: tip Account ID Tips

Because MAA's **Bilibili server account switching** uses OCR with limited accuracy, we recommend the following input strategy to improve recognition and switching success.

#### General Advice

- MAA account switching only needs to **recognize one unique fragment** to complete switching.
- Enter only a fragment unique to that account and avoid fragments shared with other accounts.
- Test in MAA whether the fragment can switch accounts correctly before entering it into AUTO-MAS.
- If there is only one account under the same server, `Account ID` can be left empty.

#### Official Server

- The official server account ID is a phone number. Usually, entering only the **last four digits** is enough. You do not need to enter the full phone number.
- Example:
  - Account 1: `133XXXX1234`
  - Account 2: `133XXXX5678`
  - To switch to Account 1, you can enter `2`, `4`, `12`, `34`, `123`, `234`, `1234`, or any other fragment unique to Account 1.

#### Bilibili Server

- Bilibili server accounts use Bilibili nicknames, which may include Chinese, English, numbers, special symbols, Japanese, and other complex characters. OCR accuracy may be low. Therefore, **do not enter the full nickname**. Enter a **unique fragment that is unlikely to be misrecognized**, and avoid:
  - Rare characters, such as `黍`, which may be recognized as something else
  - Underscores `_`, which are often misrecognized or missed
- Example:
  - Account 1: `DLmaster_361` -> enter `master` or `361`
  - Account 2: `黍的XX_1234` -> enter `1234`, `的`, or `XX`; do **not** enter `黍` or `_`

With these changes, account switching should become more stable.

### Which MAA Settings Does AUTO-MAS Override?

During an auto-proxy run, AUTO-MAS takes over some MAA settings, so whatever you set in MAA is overwritten. Knowing which ones saves you a lot of "but I definitely set that" confusion:

- **Options shown on the user configuration page always win.**
- **Annihilation task**: only **Start wakeup** and **Use sanity** are enabled, only annihilation stages are farmed, and the details are generated automatically from your user settings.
- **Daily task**: runs whatever you ticked in **Task configuration**. **The order is fixed and cannot be changed.**
- **Scheduled execution** is force-disabled, because scheduling belongs to the AUTO-MAS queue. Behavior after task completion, behavior after MAA startup, minimization, and update settings are also adjusted automatically.

Anything not taken over follows your configuration mode: **script** mode uses MAA's global settings, **user** mode uses that user's own configuration.

::: tip Only the First Task of Each Type Is Used
If you queued two tasks of the same type in MAA, for example two **Use sanity** tasks, AUTO-MAS uses only the first one. If there are none, defaults apply.

## Weekly Plans: Farm Different Stages Each Day

Want to farm EXP midweek and credits on the weekend? A weekly plan sets stages day by day.

![plan](/docs/img/advanced-features/plan-1.png)

1. Switch the configuration mode to **weekly plan mode**, then fill in what to farm each day. If the table takes up too much room, switch to **simplified view** for an editing experience similar to mower.
2. Back on the MAA user page, select your plan under **stage configuration mode**.

## Skland Automatic Check-In

::: warning Note
AUTO-MAS processes check-in requests locally and does not upload tokens to third-party servers.

Automatic check-in has risks. AUTO-MAS is not responsible for any results caused by automatic check-in. Using this feature means you agree to bear the related risks yourself.

### Get Hypergryph Account Login Credentials

1. Log in to the [Skland web page](https://www.skland.com/).

2. Visit this [URL](https://web-api.skland.com/account/info/hg).

   It returns information similar to:

   ```json
   {
     "code": 0,
     "data": {
       "content": "<Token>"
     },
     "msg": "The API returns the login credential of your Hypergryph account. This credential can be used by the Hypergryph account system to verify login validity. Leaking login credentials is extremely dangerous. For account security, do not disclose this credential to anyone in any form."
   }
   ```

3. Enter `<Token>` into the corresponding option tab in the app.

4. If you need to obtain **Hypergryph account login credentials** for multiple accounts in a row, clear browser cookies to remove login state. Logging out directly from the web page will make the token expire.

::: tip Reminder
Do not enter the quotation marks around `content`, and do not enter the entire returned page content into the option tab.
