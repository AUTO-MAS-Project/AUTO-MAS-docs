# Notifications

Get told when a run finishes or an account fails. AUTO-MAS can send that news over email, ServerChan, or a WeCom group bot.

## Two Levels: Global and Per-User

**Global notifications** are configured in **Settings > Notification Settings** and cover every task. For most people this is the only one you need.

![notification-1](/docs/img/advanced-features/notification-1.png)

**Per-user notifications** are configured in **User Configuration > Notification Settings** and let you name a separate recipient for one account. Typical case: you run accounts for a friend and he wants his own results.

::: tip A Per-User Notification Adds a Copy, It Does Not Change the Recipient
Once a per-user notification is set, the global notification still goes to you, and an extra copy goes to the address that user specifies. It does not replace the global setting.

## Email Notifications

To receive notifications by email you need three things: an **SMTP server address**, a **sending address**, and an **authorization code**. Here is how to get each one.

::: tip **AUTO-MAS private-domain email is available**

1. What is AUTO-MAS private-domain email?

- AUTO-MAS private-domain email uses the `auto-mas.top` domain through Alibaba Cloud Enterprise Mail.

2. What are its benefits?

- The domain looks more recognizable and professional.

3. How do I use AUTO-MAS private-domain email?

- The login page is [Alibaba Mail Enterprise Edition](https://qiye.aliyun.com), the SMTP server is `smtp.qiye.aliyun.com`, and the authorization code is the `login password`. Other usage is the same as normal email.

4. How do I apply for an AUTO-MAS private-domain email account?

- Send an application email to `DLmaster_361@auto-mas.top`. The email must include: `email name (English letters only)`, `security phone number`, and `application reason`. After the mailbox is created, a reply containing the `initial password` will be sent.

### SMTP Server Address

Find the provider of your sending address and copy the matching row.

| Email service provider | SMTP server address |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| **QQ Mail** | smtp.qq.com |
| **163 Mail** | smtp.163.com |
| **Gmail** | smtp.gmail.com |
| **Outlook/Hotmail** | smtp-mail.outlook.com |
| **Yahoo Mail** | smtp.mail.yahoo.com |

If your email service is not listed, search its help center for "SMTP server address".

### Get an Authorization Code

**An authorization code is not your mailbox login password.** It is a separate code your provider issues for third-party software, and you have to go and generate it yourself. Getting this wrong is the most common reason email notifications fail.

Providers name it differently: QQ Mail and 163 Mail call it an authorization code, while Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo call it an **app password**. It is the same thing, and it goes in the same field.

Where each provider hides it:

1. **QQ Mail**

<Pill name="QQ Mail official guide" image="https://res.wx.qq.com/t/webmail/webmail/res/static/images/projects/login/loginpage/qqmail_logo_default_35h.e071fb4.png" link="https://service.mail.qq.com/detail/0/75"/>

- Log in to your [QQ Mail Account and Security Center](https://wx.mail.qq.com/account).
- Go to **Account and Security > Security Settings > SMTP/IMAP Service**, enable the service, and get the authorization code.

2. **163 Mail**

<Pill name="163 Mail official guide" image="https://help.mail.163.com/style/img/logo-163.png" link="https://help.mail.163.com/faqDetail.do?code=d7a5dc8471cd0c0e8b4b8f4f8e49998b374173cfe9171305fa1ce630d7f67ac2a5feb28b66796d3b"/>

- Log in to [163 Mail](https://email.163.com).
- Go to **Settings > POP3/SMTP/IMAP**, find **IMAP/SMTP Service**, and enable it.
- In the popup, click **Continue enabling** and follow the instructions to send an SMS from your phone.
- The popup generates an **authorization password**. That is the code you need.

3. **Gmail**

- Log in to [Gmail](https://mail.google.com).
- Go to **Settings > See all settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP > IMAP access**, then select **Enable IMAP**.
- Go to **User > Manage your Google Account > Security > 2-Step Verification** and enable **2-Step Verification**.
- Go to **2-Step Verification > App passwords** and create an **app password**. That is the code you need.

4. **Outlook/Hotmail**

- Log in to your **Outlook account**.
- Go to **My Account > Security and privacy > More security options**.
- Create an app password under **App passwords**.

5. **Yahoo Mail**

- Log in to your **Yahoo account**.
- Go to the account's **Security settings**.
- Find **Generate app password** or a similar option to create an app password.

::: tip One Mailbox Is Enough
The sending address and the recipient address can be the same. Mailing yourself works fine.
:::

::: warning About the Authorization Code

- Do not share it with anyone, and rotate it now and then.
- Some providers show it **only once**, so save it as soon as you get it. Some expire, and notifications silently stop when they do, so replace it before then.
- It is stored encrypted on your machine, tied to your Windows account. **After changing computers or reinstalling Windows, you have to enter it again.**

## ServerChan (Push to Your Phone)

**ServerChan** is a relay service that forwards messages to your phone. Enter the key it gives you into AUTO-MAS and your run results get pushed to your phone.

<Box :items="[
{ name: 'ServerChan Turbo', link: 'https://sct.ftqq.com/', image: 'https://the7.ft07.com/sct/images/favicon.png' },
{ name: 'ServerChan³', link: 'https://sc3.ft07.com/', image: 'https://the7.ft07.com/sct/images/favicon.png' },
]"/>

::: warning There Are Two Versions, Don't Mix Them Up
ServerChan released a new version in 2024, and the two are separate products:

- **SCT** = ServerChan Turbo, the older version. It supports many channels, including WeChat, DingTalk, and Feishu.
- **SC3** = ServerChan³, the newer version. **It only pushes to its own app.**

Some of the settings below apply to just one version, so check before you fill them in.
:::

### SendKey (Required)

The SendKey is how ServerChan identifies you, and messages have nowhere to go without it. Get yours from the page for your version. **Pick one platform, not both:**

- SCT users: <Pill name="SCT SendKey" image="https://the7.ft07.com/sct/images/favicon.png" link="https://sct.ftqq.com/sendkey"/>
- SC3 users: <Pill name="SC3 SendKey" image="https://the7.ft07.com/sct/images/favicon.png" link="https://sc3.ft07.com/sendkey"/>

### Channel Code (SCT Only)

To push messages to WeChat, DingTalk, and similar destinations, enter the matching numeric code. **SC3 users skip this** — SC3 only has app push.

| Channel | Code |
| ------- | ---- |
| Official Android app beta | 98 |
| WeCom app message | 66 |
| WeCom group bot | 1 |
| DingTalk group bot | 2 |
| Feishu group bot | 3 |
| Bark iOS | 8 |
| Test account | 0 |
| Custom | 88 |
| PushDeer | 18 |
| Fangtang service account | 9 |

::: tip No Spaces When You List Several Channels
- Correct: `1|0|9`
- Incorrect: `1 | 0 | 9`

A wrong format does not raise an error. It silently falls back to the **default channel**, so you may think your setting took effect when it did not.
:::

### Tag (SC3 Only)

Tags label your push messages so you can sort them in the app. **SCT users skip this.**

::: tip No Spaces Here Either
- Correct: `AUTO-MAS|Status`
- Incorrect: `AUTO-MAS | Status`

Left empty or formatted wrong, messages simply arrive without tags. Pushing itself still works.
:::

## WeCom Group Bot (Push to WeChat)

::: info Set It Up Once, Then Read Messages in WeChat
You do have to register WeCom, but that is a one-time step just to obtain a bot address. After that, messages arrive in your normal WeChat.
:::

1. **Register an enterprise account**: open the <Pill name="WeCom official website" link="https://work.weixin.qq.com/" image="https://open.work.weixin.qq.com/favicon.ico" /> on a computer, follow the instructions, then log in to the WeCom client with the WeChat account you bound.

2. **Create a group and add a bot**: open the group chat, click the **...** menu in the upper-right corner, and select **Add group bot**. Name and avatar are up to you. This works on desktop and mobile alike.

3. **Get the Webhook URL**:
   - Desktop: right-click the bot in the group chat and select **View profile**.
   - Mobile: group chat, **...** menu in the upper-right corner, **Group bot**, then tap the bot.

4. **Enter it in AUTO-MAS**: paste the Webhook URL into **Push WeCom bot notification**. Done.
