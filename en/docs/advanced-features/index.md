# Advanced Features

Once the basics are working, these features make life easier:

- [Emulator Management](./emulator) - register your emulator once and AUTO-MAS fills in the emulator settings for every script. Set this up first if you use an emulator.
- [Push Notifications](./notification) - sends a message to your email or phone when automation finishes.
- [Game Check-in](./game-sign) - takes care of the daily check-ins on each game's community site while it is at it.
- [MCP Service](./mcp) - lets an AI operate AUTO-MAS for you.
